                            <p>Cryptocurrencies or digital assets issued to employees by crypto exchanges as incentives are set to come under the taxman's lens.
        
                                The question is whether the coins - most of them issued by Indian exchanges - can be construed as income and what could be the income tax applicable on the digital assets.

                        <h1>Virat's resignation is a victory of mediocrity over talent</h1>
                        <p>Virat Kohli’s resignation from Test captaincy has been in the works for a while now. It has been clear for some time that his relationship with the BCCI has soured, and that his departure was only a matter of time. His ouster from ODI captaincy was handled in an unsavoury way; hardly the kind of reward that someone with his track record deserved. Although his resignation is voluntary, it is difficult not to believe that he has been pushed into a corner and that this was the only way out for him.</p>
